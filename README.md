I created two terraform modules for provisioning one AWS and one Azure instance.

Variables were used when creating modules.

I made my instances available to everyone on the web.

Public IP addresses were added to the output values.

Grafana was installed to my AWS and Azure instances.

You need to go to providers.tf and write your credentials.
